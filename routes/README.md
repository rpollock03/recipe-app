iCook v1

A simple web application for saving and sharing recipes

---------------------------------------------

After registering, users can login to a home page where they can add new recipes or view recipes they have added previously. Via the 'explore' tab, users can browse and comment on recipes submitted by others. Users can edit comments/recipes but only those that they have authored. Password and other user data can be changed via the 'settings' tab. 

- iCook is built using the NodeJS web application framework Express.
- User authentication is managed via passportJS and the MongoDB database is used for recipe/comment storage.
- The site is styled using Bootstrap; Googlefonts; Fontawesome icons; JQuery and CSS

The various recipes I normally use are scattered across many different websites which are often bloated with excessive advertising, photographs and other unecessary information. This web app is intended to be a simple, clean and elegant solution to this problem.
